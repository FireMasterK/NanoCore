    PermissionEx is no longer depending for the HCFactions to work properly.
        Vault has taken it's place means that you can use every permission plugin.
    Auto-Scheduler or Auto-Run for events have been due to high demands.
        Check config how to set it up.
    Along with Auto-Scheduler, I've  also In-Game command for it which is /event schedule.
        Usage: /event schedule <list|next|shuffle|rotate|start|reload>
     new event called "Palace", basically it's same as KOTH just that the time is longer and configurable (by default 25mins).
        Please test this event and report if you find any bugs.
     new event called "Ender Dragon".
        Startable only in the END environment.
        Please test this event and report if you find any bugs.
    AutoSave is now editable in the config where you can enable/disable it and set the save time interval.
    Deathbans for the KitMap mode are now automaticly disabled so there is no need to add "hcf.deathban.bypass" in the KitMap server.
    For those who use kSpigot - ExoSpigot as dependency for the server, I've  now 2 jars in the download folder.
    (If you are using normal spigot as dependency just ignore this)
